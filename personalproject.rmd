**Introduction**

The prevalence and versatility of portable personal smart devices has a profound impact on lifestyles and aspirations of those living in modern society. The pervasiveness of personal mobile phone devices is a key example, providing basic communication functions and supporting applications for social media and networking, entertainment, shopping, education and fitness among others. Their all-encompassing functionality, while providing a myriad of modern conveniences, enforces a high level of dependency on these devices to partake in a highly dynamic socio-technological ecosystem essential to modern social connectivity and dissemination of most contemporary culture. Frequently seen in the case of social media, this dependence is highly problematic to emotional well-being, exacerbating physical health concerns ^[Bekalu, M. A., McCloud, R. F., & Viswanath, K. (2019). Association of Social Media Use With Social Well-Being, Positive Mental Health, and Self-Rated Health: Disentangling Routine Use From Emotional Connection to Use. Health education & behavior: the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education, 46(2_suppl), 69–80. https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198119863768] developed from prolonged, sedentary device use. These can range from eyestrain and disrupted sleep from the artificial light ^[Park, Y. H., An, C. M., & Moon, S. J. (2017). Effects of visual fatigue caused by smartphones on balance function in healthy adults. Journal of physical therapy science, 29(2), 221–223. https://doi.org/10.1589/jpts.29.221]; more direct impacts, such as musculoskeletal (e.g., pain and weakened muscle groups from poor posture), or indirect, like respiratory issues from poor posture ^[Jung, S. I., Lee, N. K., Kang, K. W., Kim, K., & Lee, D. Y. (2016). The effect of smartphone usage time on posture and respiratory function. Journal of physical therapy science, 28(1), 186–189. https://doi.org/10.1589/jpts.28.186]. As a consequence of this, the entities that control the supply of these devices have created an effective duopoly, not only in the market for the devices, but over our daily lives. In light of the extensive influence of mobile devices on our physical well-being, social engagement and lifestyle, this report investigates the following question:

What can be discovered about ourselves by comparison across mobile phone generated physical activity, mobile device activity and social media parameters?

4 sources of data were collected for the purpose of investigating this question. Two sources of data were collected in collaboration with peers from the Data Science for Innovation cohort (Best in DSI), one structured and one unstructured, in addition to individually collated personal and external cohort-level data. 

**Methods**

*Data Collection*

Multiple personal data sources were collected for analysis across collection period March 8 to April 18. Choices of data was informed by brainstorming both in person and via WhatsApp messaging. Social media data and mobile screen time (ST) of each member was decided to be used for unstructured and structured data. The required unstructured source was chosen to be Instagram due data availability to all members and ease of accessibility via account settings. The data chosen for collection, a comprehensive file of various data types, also provided an abundant opportunity for diverse analyses and comparison. It included user activity logs, user information, device information, contacts, social network, targeted advertising and activity-based predicted interest topics (IT). The subfolder, “your_topics” containing the ITs was chosen due to potentially unique insights to be gained from analysis alongside concerns of maintaining privacy and confidentiality. It was hypothesised that predicted ITs for members would be associated with ST spent on related categories and physical activity participation as indicated by fitness ST. For comparison, publicly available top 100 Instagram hashtags was used as a proxy for general user activity/ITs instead of actual ITs.

Structured data collected was total and categorised daily mobile ST. Similar to Instagram data, it was chosen due to availability and accessibility to all members, via built-in or third-party monitoring applications. Categorised ST was hypothesised to be representative of individual daily lifestyles and potentially members’ personal interests, such as higher fitness ST associated with more fitness ITs or higher social ST related to greater total ITs. Also, it was hypothesised that individual total ST would be greater for those with many technological ITs.

Daily step count (SC) and fitness ST was chosen for personal physical activity and group parameters. This choice was informed by associations between sedentary activity and poor health outcomes3, device-application compatibility due to more consistent mobile usage over wearable fitness trackers and ST collection use. SC would be compared to ITs as well as total and categorised ST. It was hypothesised that physical activity would be negatively correlated with STs, except for fitness ST. Further, comparison of ITs and physical activity (as indicated by fitness ST and SC) with the hashtags was of interest: exploration of this could provide an indication of physical activity participation of the average Instagram user.

```

*Data Anonymity*

Attempts to anonymise group datasets included choice of alphabetic initial(s) to represent members in shared spreadsheets and files. For ST recording in Google Sheets, all members used both individual anonymised sheets for daily categorised ST and a shared sheet for daily total ST in anonymised columns. Names of shared Instagram files were anonymised prior to group data sharing.   

**Analysis**

Initially, a comparative boxplot for the group was generated, figure1. There were multiple outliers for K (1 outlier) and MU (5 outliers); Z exhibited a significantly larger range, from 0 to 695 minutes (11 hours 35 minutes); and higher median compared to the rest of the group. Examining the data set, lower end of the Z’s ST range was likely caused by a 3-day period of 0 ST minutes. Interestingly, K’s outlier and two of MU’s upper outliers occurred during the same 3-day period of 0 ST minutes recorded for Z.  

```{r add_picture4, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here( "figure1.png"))
```

Figure2 comparison of total daily STs revealed different relationships of each member’s ST with progression of the data collection: K and Z’s ST tended to decline over time (K more strongly), whereas M, MU and X’s ST increased (most strongly seen in X).  

```{r add_picture5, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here( "fig2.png"))
```

 Figure3 was generated to better understand member mobile use patterns. Entertainment was the most dominant category for Z and K, whereas for M, MU and X social was the majority. Health & fitness (H&F) ST proportion is highest in MU, education highest for K, productivity & finance (P&F) greatest in MU, photography & creativity (P&C) largest in X, and MU having the most travel ST.

```{r add_picture6, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here( "fig3.png"))
```

Figure4 provided an overview of the relationships of each category with day of collection. A positive relation was seen for most of the group for P&F and a negative correlation was evident for H&F, in addition to most members for education.

```{r add_picture7, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here( "fig4.png"))
```

“your_topics” revealed substantial differences in number of topics: 197 for Z, 184 for X, 174 for K, 164 for M and 109 for MU. Correlation comparison between individual ITs with individual total ST and total social ST computed a Pearson correlation of 0.611 and 0.961. This reconfirmed Instagram as a primary social mobile application for the group, further supporting Instagram as an indicator of group mobile social activity. ITs were analysed with a Google Sheets Text Analysis add-on to classify ITs into 15 unique topics which were then re-classified into the 5 categories seen in figure5. From figure5, majority of group engagement is in entertainment & recreation (E&R) posts and accounts, followed by Humanities.

```{r add_picture8, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here( "fig5.png"))
```

Figure6 compares ITs within the group. MU has greatest proportion of E&R and Health & Medicine (H&M); Z highest in humanities; M highest in education and K highest in technology. Also, of interest was number of Technology classified topics and its relationship with overall ST. This was revealed to be strong (0.7136), represented by colour depth in a correlation matrix exploring the relationships between reclassified categories with categorised ST (figure7).

```{r add_picture9, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here( "fig6.png"))
```

Figure7 shows a range of other significant and interesting relationships for the group, seen summarised in the table in figure8.

```{r add_picture10, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here( "fig7.png"))
```

```{r add_picture11, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here( "fig8.png"))
```

Additionally, it was seen that total ST was positively correlated to E&R, Humanities, Technology ITs and P&C ST, whereas it had an inverse relation with Education IT and H&F ST.

With the previous findings in mind, topics of top 100 hashtags were mined and reclassified into the categories created for group IT for comparison ease. Proportions are seen in figure9, as well as my personal reclassified ITs proportions. Similarity evaluation to the general Instagram population by Pearson correlation was found to be 0.8464 for group and 0.8996 for personal ITs, indicative of high similarity. Even greater similarity was found between myself and the group, 0.9852. Deviations can be seen arising from higher group proportions of education, E&R and Technology ITs compared to the greater Instagram population Humanities and H&M interest.

```{r add_picture12, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here( "fig9.png"))
```

Lower H&M ITs was investigated in relation to personal fitness activity parameters with findings from figure2 in mind (lower ST as semester progressed): comparison can be seen in figure10. H&F ST was confirmed to be somewhat representative of physical activity, as well as presenting a positive relationship with Travel ST (stronger association). Time-based variable inclusion, informed by figure2, showed semester week not only was negatively related to total and travel ST, but had a stronger negative influence on H&F ST. SC was also seen to be influenced by weekdays, tending to be higher later in the week.

```

**Findings**

Exploration of the mobile, social and physical activity through metrics obtained via personal mobile devices produced a wealth of group insights, myself included. Total mobile ST was examined initially, showing that different patterns of use existed within the group. Some members, including myself, exhibited greater usage earlier in the semester: this was found to be consistent with primary use of mobile activity for entertainment ST (as seen in my own life). Members with higher proportions of mobile activity with P&F showed higher use further along into the semester, presenting the second pattern of mobile use. Overall increase of P&F as well as decrease in Education and H&F ST through the collection period of the group were expected with greater workload as the semester progressed, leading to changed priorities toward more traditional forms of education materials e.g., computer or textbook. This is somewhat consistent with my personal ST, with only social and P&F ST increasing through the semester due to greater need for peer communication in completing group assessments. 

Group ITs were found to be relatively similar and dominated by E&R and Humanities topics despite significantly different topic numbers for each member. Variance in IT numbers was seen to heavily reflect the amount of social ST, leading to the conclusion that ITs were a good indicator of group social activity. The hypothesised relation between total ST and technology interest was also found to be strong, likely due to the preference of using mobile devices for tasks over conventional methods as is true for myself. 

Comparison of ITs and categorised ST revealed significant positive correlation of ITs with associated ST categories, with the exception of education. Other interesting findings included negative relations between P&F ST and education topics, as well as total with H&F ST and education topics. These phenomena could be explained by preference of more traditional education media and different mobile use patterns. This would also explain higher travel ST relation to greater H&M topics and ST, likely due to more outdoor exercise and less sedentary behaviour. Likewise, this could be said for travel ST’s negative association with humanities, education topics and social and entertainment ST. P&F ST was seen to correlate with P&C, possibly indicating creative work fields for the group. 

These ST insights were then used to further explore group and personal patterns of behaviour relative to the general Instagram population. Less P&F, P&C, travel, H&F ST and more education and social ST were predicted for the group with the earlier findings: this likely being also true for myself due to substantial IT similarity. Taking this into consideration with the negative relation between H&F ST and sedentary activity, the group (myself included) is likely to exhibit less physical activity than the general Instagram population. My personal activity was further examined in this context, finding that I exhibited low H&F ST even in relation to the group. The key factors associated this activity was found to be travel ST, and to a lesser extent, H&F ST and day of the week (higher later in the week). Low H&F and travel ST themselves were also seen to be attributed to later semester weeks.  

**Discussion**

*Privacy*

Confidentiality and privacy actions were informed by the 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APP). Most relevant were APP1, APP2, APP3, APP4, APP6, APP11 and APP12: these focused on transparency, anonymity, personal information collection, data use, security and individual access ^[Australian Government. Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (n.d.) Australian Privacy Principles quick reference.  Available at: https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/australian-privacy-principles-quick-reference/ (accessed 30 May 2021)]. To anonymise shared data within the group, group members were de-identified with alphabetical initials. Several issues with this were found. The preferred method of sharing files and collaboration on Google Drive proved very counteractive to attempts to de-identify members. Account names of members accessing the workbook to record ST would be displayed as active users and in selected cells. Multiple members also chose alphabetic characters that mirrored portions of the individuals’ names. Consequently, multiple identities could be easily inferred from activity in specific spreadsheets of the workbook or from the chosen characters: this could lead to deduction remaining members.  

Likewise, Instagram files anonymisation did not achieve the desired effect of de-identification. The files were large, containing many folders which themselves contained multiple levels of sub folders. Many contained highly identifying information hidden within, including names, synced personal contacts, posted photos, as well as other sensitive and potentially identifying information such as device information and private messages. Through Google Drive group file sharing, the uploader’s identity would also be indicated by the “Last Modified” column displayed adjacent to the file. These issues are seen to be highly problematic due to others' access to the information and the potential harm that could be inflicted utilising the data. 

Whilst security measures were employed through password protection and access-limited files, entities other than those within the group were identified to have the capability to access the data. Entities and people with access to the data other than application and Instagram collection sources include Google Drive and Sheets, UTS IT administrators, third-party MonkeyLearn Text Analysis Add-On (Google Sheets), MDSI staff and students under various conditions: IT administration and storage, data analysis, peer review and staff marking. On a smaller scale, individuals' personal data could be used for identity theft, extortion ^[Lee, W W, Zankl, W & Chang, H (2016) ‘An Ethical Approach to Data Privacy Protection’, ISACA Journal, vol. 6, 2016, viewed 30 May 2021, <https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2016/volume-6/an-ethical-approach-to-data-privacy-protection >], intellectual property appropriation, discrimination or contribute to less likely organised exploitation such as malware attacks, social engineering ^[OECD (2019), ‘Enhancing Access to and Sharing of Data: Reconciling Risks and Benefits for Data Re-use across Societies’, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/276aaca8-en.], information warfare and cyberterrorism ^[Lee, W W, Zankl, W & Chang, H (2016) ‘An Ethical Approach to Data Privacy Protection’, ISACA Journal, vol. 6, 2016, viewed 30 May 2021, <https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2016/volume-6/an-ethical-approach-to-data-privacy-protection>]. The Colonial Pipeline cyber-attack, leading to closure of a critical petrol and diesel pipeline supplying 45percent of US east coast, is one instance of inadequate data security measures resulting in disastrous consequences ^[Radichel, T (2021) ‘Colonial Pipeline Hack’, Medium, 16 May. Available at: https://medium.com/cloud-security/colonial-pipeline-hack-4486d16f2957 (accessed 30 May 2021)]. However, similar events occurring as a direct result of stakeholders of this task is unlikely, especially between fellow members considering the reciprocal sharing of personal data and group transparency, other DSI students due to the nature of MDSI, MDSI and UTS staff duty of care relating to students' data privacy, reputation and business interests of Google LLC and MonkeyLearn Studio (third-party text analysis add-on).  

*Legal and Policy Concerns*

For all use of the collected data, UTS Acceptable Use of Information Technology Facilities policies are applicable due to the group's use of UTS. The terms of ethical, socially responsible, legal, academic standards of conduct, competent and efficient use greatly influenced the way in which tasks for this report were conducted, especially in relation to the group Instagram data collected ^[ UTS (2001) Acceptable Use of Information Technology Facilities, UTS, viewed 30 May 2021, <https://www.gsu.uts.edu.au/policies/itfacilities.html>]. Care was taken in selecting data for analysis by examining my own Instagram file to understand the folder structure and content prior to extracting chosen datasets from my group-mates' files. Any unused data was then removed from my device; however, the files were left available on Google Drive to enable access for other members. Removal of unnecessary data was done to avoid access of others' potentially sensitive data and to select data that would be least problematic for analysis and inference relative to privacy and confidentiality concerns. Additionally, federal and state privacy legislation, Privacy Act 1988 ^[ICLG (2020) Data Protection Laws and Regulations, ICLG, viewed 30 May 2021, <https://iclg.com/practice-areas/data-protection-laws-and-regulations/australia>], NSW Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act ^[Australian Government, Information and Privacy Commission (2020) PPIP Act. Available at: https://www.ipc.nsw.gov.au/privacy/nsw-privacy-laws/ppip], as well as regulation regarding the harms can be done with the data (e.g., anti-discrimination, copyright and intellectual property rights) shaped data use in this task. The latter is particularly relevant to the Instagram data as social media platforms thrive from connecting people of common interests, encouraging a diverse range of personal data to be shared within private social networks or even publicly. Much of these types of information are often targeted by malicious entities or persons with ill-intent: religious beliefs, age, race, disability, sexual orientation, original designs or private proclivities. Often female LGBTQ+ persons are social marginalised, subject to higher levels of prejudice and micro-aggressions than their male counterparts ^[Zurbrugg, l & Miner, K N (2016) ‘Gender, Sexual Orientation, and Workplace Incivility: Who Is Most Targeted and Who Is Most Harmed?’, Front. Psychol., 2016. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00565.].  

*Ethics*

Bounded by privacy and legal regulations informed by ethical conduct, ethical practice throughout data management was key. To achieve this, relevant frameworks were sought out to inform project planning and task completion. Frameworks were to encompass general ethics principles such as integrity, objectiveness, transparency, accountability, robustness, efficiency and independence, while relating to data practice. The following 6 main principles were found to be appropriate in advising conduct in the context of this task: beginning with established need(s) and corresponding public benefit; limiting intrusion of data and analytical tools; awareness of public perceptions; transparency and accountability; and data security ^[Hand, D J (2018) ‘Aspects of Data Ethics in a Changing World: Where Are We Now?’, Big Data, vol. 6, no. 2, https://doi.org/10.1089/big.2018.0083]. These notions were especially prominent in formulating investigated question as well as the methods and data through which it was to be answered. In spite of these steps, the principle of reducing data intrusion was applied to a substandard manner compared to other ethical considerations. This was due to inconsistent application of confidentiality measures across the group and sources, undermining effectiveness of employed privacy plans. Whilst impact for this instance is likely to be minimal, similar lapses in future data conduct could lead to serious consequences, especially when dealing with datasets of a more significant scale. This could potentially include legal disciplinary repercussions under the Privacy Act 1988 for questionable proportionality and data minimisation practices, having facilitated a broad collection of data by selecting an intentionally open research question and poor de-identification practices. In commercial data breaches, the significance of proportionality and data minimisation management is obvious: poor ethical conduct by Ashley Madison in not eliminating customer data upon request led to leakage of highly sensitive personal and financial information ^[Thomsen, S (2015) ‘Extramarital affair website Ashley Madison has been hacked and attackers are threatening to leak data online’, Business Insider, 20 July, Available at: https://www.businessinsider.com/cheating-affair-website-ashley-madison-hacked-user-data-leaked-2015-7?IR=T (Accessed 30 May 2021)]. Further, inattention to these concerns without the guidance of relevant frameworks like the Ethical OS Checklist enables development of larger scale socio-political problems of data monetisation, control and surveillance states ^[Institute for the Future and Omidyar Network (2018) Ethical OS, IFTF, viewed 30 May, <https://ethicalos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/EthicalOS_Check-List_080618.pdf>].

**Reflection**

Engaging novel data innovation of the quantified self, this project enabled for greater understandings into behaviours and interests of the group, especially in relation to myself. Represented by Z throughout task, examining my data within and against group and cohort level data provided the opportunity to better quantify social, physical and lifestyle behaviours through the lens of mobile use. ST and IT findings confirm my high level of mobile dependence (especially in comparison with the group) for social and entertainment purposes, in contrast with fitness and education. This aligns closely with my perceived mobile ST, featuring background music/video entertainment in most daily tasks: cooking, eating, travelling, sleeping, grooming, academic productivity, fitness and household work. Quantified fitness (SC) and education mobile use too mirrored actual behaviour patterns exhibited: greater sedentary behaviour, due resistance-based exercise programming; and minimal non-traditional education media during the semester. These results reveal opportunities to improve on my own lifestyle through reducing mobile use, sedentary behaviour, and dependence on Instagram for improved physical and mental health in the form of better eye health, posture, muscular imbalances, respiratory function and emotional health outcomes. Recommendations for similar projects in future would be more meticulous team discussions specifying de-identification strategies, detailing storage, recording, collaborative and anonymisation methods that are synergistic in the goal of achieving data privacy. These improvements stem mainly from privacy considerations:

-	numbers instead of alphabet initials to represent individuals
-	metadata deletion
-	anonymous file-sharing sites
-	USBs: upload and redistribution group/cohort data 
-	pseudonymised account names in Google Sheets/Drive 

Other changes that could be made focus on error reduction, exporting datasets instead of manual recording and consistent application use across group; as well as defining more narrow research questions. Prominently, proportionality and data minimisation concerns were critical, not only this task, but also to the wider practice of data science due to the widespread harm it can facilitate. This is particularly apparent in the context of this research question, requiring investigation of personal information to produce insights on cohort, group and personal social, physical and lifestyle (as represented by ST) activity patterns. Discoveries could be used to ascertain specific socio-cultural, health and behaviour characteristics deemed to be sensitive information. Examining these issues projected to a larger scale reveals a greater need for organisations to improve their data policies and codes of conduct, in addition to putting this into practice.
